# One Direction – 18

```
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me
I wanna use them both
We made a start
be it a false one I know
Baby I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
Yeah, I have loved you
since we were 18
Long before we both
thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do
is say that these arms were
made for holding you
oh oh oh whoa
I wanna love
like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along
I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything
we can living love
in slow motion motion motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you
since we were 18
Long before we both
thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do
is say that these arms were
made for holding you
oh oh oh oh
And I wanna love like you
made me feel
when we were 18
When we were 18
When we were 18
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you
since we were 18
Long before we both
thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do
is say that these arms were
made for holding you
oh oh oh oh
And I wanna love like you
made me feel
when we were 18
And I wanna love like you
made me feel
when we were 18
And I wanna love like you
made me feel
when we were 18
