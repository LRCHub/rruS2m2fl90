I saw some old friends as I came to the city gate
They asked me where I'd been of late
I hadn't been anywhere, but what was I going to say
Two hopeful people looking at me that way
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
You can't comprehend what it's like
We stood in the sunlight and they asked me where I'd been
Held the gate open, told me to come on in
I saw the damp green grass so nice on the other side
Couldn't explain myself to them but I tried
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like
Ground was dry but giving, the sky was nearly black
Saw some old friends when I looked back
Remember my old home, haven't forgotten yet
What happens on the day when I forget
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like
